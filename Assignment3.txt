Assignment Instructions
1- Create a new branch called feature/login. Switch to the new branch.
 - git Branch feature/login
 - git checkout feature/login
 - git switch -C feature/login

2- Show all the branches.
 - git branch 

3- Update file1.txt in the current branch (feature/login) and make a new commit.
 - git commit -am "commited feature/login"

4- Show the commits across all branches.
 - git log --oneline --all

5- Switch back to the master branch. Show the commits in the feature branch that don’t exist on master.
 - git switch master
 - git log main..feature/main

6- View the differences between master and feature/login.
 - git diff master.. feature/login 

 7- Merge feature/login into master.
 - git merge feature/login 

8- View the merged and unmerged branches.
 - git branch --merged 
 - git branch --no-merged

9- Delete the feature branch.
 - git branch -d feature/login

10- Create a new branch called feature/logout. On this branch, write blue to file1.txt and make a commit.
 - git branch feature/login
 - git checkout feature/login 
 - git commit -am "blue added to file1.txt"
  
Switch back to master, write green to file1.txt and make another commit.
 - git switch master 
 - git commit -am "green added to file1.txt" 

Try to merge your feature branch into master. You’ll see a conflict. Resolve the conflict by accepting both changes. When you’re done merging, delete the new branch.
 - git merge feature/logout
 - git branch -d feature/logout

11- Create a new branch called bugfix/login. On this branch, write orange to file1.txt and make a commit.
 - git branch bugfix/login
 - git checkout bugfix/login
 - git commit -am "orange added tyo file1.txt" 

Switch back to master, write green to file2.txt and make another commit. View a graph of your branches. You’ll see divergence.
Rebase the new branch on top of master.
 - git switch master 
 - git commit -am "green added to file2.txt"
 - git log --oneline --all --graph
 - git rebase bugfix/login

View the graph of branches again. Note that the divergence is gone.
 - git log --oneline --all --graph 

Do a fast-forward merge to bring the changes in the bugfix branch into master.
 - git switch bugfix/login 
 - git merge main
